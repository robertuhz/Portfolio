# [Project 1: What Makes a Hit Song?] [(https://github.com/robertuhz/portfolio/blob/main/spotify_sql_project.sql)](https://github.com/robertuhz/portfolio/blob/main/spotify_sql_project.sql)

Project with Spotify data using SQL/Tableau. I chose the data because have always had a knack for hearing a song early and predicting if it would go viral. I was curious about answering if there are tangible metrics that can aid in determining if a new track will be a hit or not.

Dataset includes the most streamed songs on Spotify over a 20 year period, along with measures of other characters (tempo, danceability, explicit, etc.)

Link to dataset and notes guiding the thought process/elicited requirements are within the SQL file.
